### :octocat: 

### How It Works:

:curly_loop: Each character you serach for will form a button. When you click the button, the page will display 10 gifs of that character using [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/). 

:curly_loop: Gifs are static when the page is loaded, when you click on them, they will be dynamic. You can stop them by clicking on them once again.

:curly_loop: With each character, a random adventure time quote will appear in the gray box, using [Adventure time quote API](https://adventure-time-quote-api.glitch.me/).  

:curly_loop: _Have fun!_
